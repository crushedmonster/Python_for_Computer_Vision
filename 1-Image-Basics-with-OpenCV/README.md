# Image Basics with OpenCV
In this section we will begin building an understanding of how to use the OpenCV library. Specifically how to open images and draw on them.

## Introduction:
* OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
* Created by Intel in 1999, it is written in C++ (we will be using the Python bindings)
* It contains many popular algorithms for computer vision, including object detection and tracking algorithms built-in.

**Section Goals:**
* Be able to open image files with OpenCV in both a notebook and a python script.
* Draw simple geometries on images.
* Directly interact with an image through callbacks.

## Opening Image Files Notebook
1. Opening Images Files OpenCV Python Script
Run the script to open `00-puppy.jpg` from our [DATA](../DATA) folder.

```
python mypuppy.py
```
